- Community members have been testing in Sandbox.
- Scott mentioned that a provider is having an issue with leases not being withdrawn from. This is a very rare issue. This is happening in Helm and in praetor builds. Scott suspects 5% of providers.
- Artur said he thinks he knows where this issue is. The quickest fix is to restart provider.
- Artur asked what is the least withdrawal time for those? Scott thinks it is 12 hours.
